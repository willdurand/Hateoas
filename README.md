### Introduction

**Hateoas** leverages the [Serializer](github.com/schmittjoh/serializer) library
to provide a nice way to build HATEOAS REST web services. HATEOAS stands for
**H**ypermedia **a**s **t**he **E**ngine **o**f **A**pplication **S**tate, and
basically adds **hypermedia links** to your **representations** (ie. your API
responses). [HATEOAS is about the discoverability of actions on a
resource](http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas).

For instance, let's say you have a User API that returns a **representation** of
a single _user_ as follow:

```json
{
    "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe"
    }
}
```

In order to tell your API consumers how to retrieve the data for this specific
user, you have to add your very first **link** to this representation, let's
call it `self` as it is the URI for this particular user:

```json
{
    "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "_links": {
            "self": { "href": "http://example.com/api/users/123" }
        }
    }
}
```

Generally speaking, a **resource** owns its own **actions** and `self` is a
well-known relation name. Let's dig into Hateoas now.
